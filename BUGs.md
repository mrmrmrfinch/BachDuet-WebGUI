# Known Bugs

## Backend
Rarely, there is a tick misalignment at the begging. Trying to figure out why this happens. Can't reproduce it consistenly.
## GUI
- Only at the very beggining, hitting 'SPACE' key doesnt seem to activate the clock. 
### GameUI
- When pausing the clock any active notes from the AI are keep scrolling (until we start the clock again)
### KeyboardUI

### ScoreUI
- Staff length is not enough. After some time, we have notes but not staff.
- inter-measure ties don't appear correctly
- ~~sharps are not printed~~

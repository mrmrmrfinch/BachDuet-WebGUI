# Known Bugs

## Backend
Rarely, there is a tick misalignment at the begging. Trying to figure out why this happens. Can't reproduce it consistenly.
## GUI
- Hitting 'SPACE' key doesnt always seem to activate/deactivate the clock. 
### GameUI
- When pausing the clock any active notes from the AI are keep scrolling (until we start the clock again)
### KeyboardUI

### ScoreUI
- Staff length is not enough. After some time, we have notes but not staff.
- inter-measure ties work only when debugging the code line by line

# BachDuet Web GUI
A Web GUI for BachDuet.
Still under development. Basically nothing has been done. It doesn't work at all. Don't install BachDuet. BachDuet is not ready! He will suffer! It's not his decision to be born!

## What's Done Now?
- Keyboard UI, with Oct Up and Down.
- Demo Playback, playing back midi.
- Piano instrument, along with other samplers (cello and violin) available.

## TODOs
- [BUG] Keyboard UI does not trigger the active state when in demo playback.
- [BUG] Piano samples are lagging in sample triggering. It appears now all samples are loaded for every change.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Add Metronome feature. Right now it's just a dummy button.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Replace the piano sample with full range and better sounding. This sounds like shit.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Write a good button style.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Try to integrate Vuex for global status management.
